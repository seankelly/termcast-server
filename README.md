# termcastd

termcastd is a from scratch implementation of termcast in Rust.

## What is termcast?

Termcast was inspired by [dgamelaunch] allowing live viewing of people playing NetHack on [nethack.alt.org].
A simple service was created that allowed people to broadcast their terminals for others to watch.
